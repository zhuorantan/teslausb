# Setting up external USB drive (SSD) with Pi4 
This guide will walk you through how to use Pi4 and a separate USB drive to to host your CAM and MUSIC files. 

#### Limitations
- Early release. Still being tested - 9.2019
- Supports manual setup. Not tested yet with headless setup. 
- Pi4 does not support booting from USB drive. A SD card is still needed for boot. It can be as small as 4GB and no high endurance required as most data will be written and read from the attached USB. 
- Will erase entire disk. All data on disk will be lost. 
- Cannot resize existing partitions. 

## Hardware
1. Raspberry Pi4 - Any RAM option will work. 
2. At least 4GB SD card - !! ONLY IF USING AN EXTERNAL DRIVE !! Refer to main page if you are not using external drive. 
3. USB Drive - SSD preferred due to low power requirements. 
4. Optional, but highly recommended - Heatsink case as Pi4 can get very hot. 
5. Optional - X855 mSata board for a more compact setup. 

## teslausb_setup_variables.conf configuration
To use an external USB drive, you will need to add 
``` export USB_DRIVE=/dev/sdX ``` to teslausb_setup_variables.conf file.
Ensure that you are providing the disk location and not a partition.

The rest of the setup is the same as the installation steps found in the main page. Both /backingfiles and /mutable will be on the external drive and the SD card will be read-only.
